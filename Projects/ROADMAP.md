# 🗺️ Development Roadmap

> DSA + Development Side by Side Strategy

---

## 📅 When to Start Development?

| DSA Progress | Development Action |
|--------------|-------------------|
| After Arrays & Hashing | Start learning HTML/CSS |
| After Two Pointers & Sliding Window | Start JavaScript basics |
| After Stack & Binary Search | Build first project (Todo App) |
| After Linked Lists & Trees | Learn React |
| After Graphs & DP | Build advanced projects |

**Rule:** Spend 70% time on DSA, 30% on Development initially. Flip it once DSA basics are done.

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Don't wait to be "ready"** - Start building after learning basics
2. **Build in public** - Share progress on LinkedIn/Twitter
3. **Clone first, create later** - Rebuild existing apps to learn
4. **Focus on one stack** - MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) is enough
5. **Deploy everything** - Even small projects should be live
